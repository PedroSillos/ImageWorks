# ImageWorks
In march/2019 I created this repository just to test if my git environment was working.
It was named 'ImageProject', and it's description was 'Editing an image with basic git commands'.

Now I'am in a new journey to learn something new every week and upload to my github page.
This time, I am working in image processing with python, so it is possible to say 'ImageProject' evolved! ðŸŽ‰

I am keeping the old file from 2019 in a separate directory, for old times sake.
